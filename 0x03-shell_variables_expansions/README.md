This README file provides an overview of the various components and concepts related to shell scripts, init files, variables, and expansions.

Shell Scripts
Shell scripts are plain text files that contain a series of commands written in a shell programming language, such as Bash, sh, or csh. These scripts are executed by the shell interpreter, which interprets and executes each command sequentially.
